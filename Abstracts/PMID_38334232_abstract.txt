OBJECTIVES: The safety, efficacy, and cost savings associated with biosimilar medications are well established. However, a lack of pediatric data exists surrounding clinical outcomes when switching from an originator to a biosimilar. Our primary aim is to evaluate clinical outcomes following a nonmedical switch from the infliximab originator to a biosimilar in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our secondary aim is to estimate cost savings associated with this switch. METHODS: A quality improvement project was implemented to establish safe switching protocols, then those patients who underwent a nonmedical switch from the infliximab originator to the biosimilar were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, physician global assessments (PGAs), and laboratory values were recorded 1 year pre- and post-switch. Continuation rates on the biosimilar were reported at 6 and 12 months. Cost savings were estimated using two different pricing models. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients underwent a nonmedical switch. Laboratory values including inflammatory markers, infliximab levels, and PGA scores remained similar when assessed pre- and post-switch. No infusion reactions or antidrug antibody development occurred. Two patients reported psoriasis-like rashes. Five patients switched back to the originator during the study period. There were 379 biosimilar infusions completed with an estimated total cost savings of $11,260 (average sales price) and $566,223 (wholesale acquisition cost). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical remission rates, inflammatory laboratory markers, serious adverse events, infliximab levels, and antidrug antibodies remained similar after a one-time nonmedical switch to an infliximab biosimilar. Nonmedical switching to biosimilars resulted in significant cost savings.
