BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) result from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Preliminary findings suggest that susceptibility genes differ between IBD patients in Asia and the West. We aimed to evaluate disease-predisposing genes in Asian IBD patients. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed of published studies from 1950 to 2010 using keyword searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, and BIOSIS Previews. RESULTS: In all, 477 abstracts were identified and data extracted from 93 studies, comprising 17,976 IBD patients and 27,350 age- and sex-matched controls. Major nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-2 variants in Western Crohn's disease (CD) patients were not associated with CD in Han Chinese, Japanese, South Korean, Indian, and Malaysian populations. New NOD2 mutations were, however, associated with CD in Malaysians (JW1), Han Chinese, and Indians (P268S). Autophagy-related protein 16-linked 1 (ATG16L1) was not associated with CD in East Asians (odds ratio [OR] 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-1.13). Interleukin (IL)-23R was associated with CD in South Koreans (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.16-2.82) and a single nucleotide polymorphism in IL-23R (Gly149Arg) was protective of CD in Han Chinese (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.15-0.60). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily gene-15 (SF15) polymorphisms were associated with CD (OR 2.68; 95% CI 1.86-3.86), while TNF-308 polymorphisms (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.15-2.9), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.22-6.22) and MICA allele (OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.89-3.07) were associated with ulcerative colitis in Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic mutations of IBD in Asians differ from Caucasians. New mutations and susceptibility genes identified in Asian IBD patients provide an opportunity to explore new disease-associated mechanisms in this population of rising incidence.
