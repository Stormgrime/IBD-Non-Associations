Genome-wide association studies identified many loci associated with the two forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Components of the interleukin-23 signalling pathway, such as IL23R, JAK2 and STAT3, have been implicated in both diseases. In addition, emerging evidence supports the role of IL23-driven Th17 cells in inflammation. Here, we studied the susceptibility nature of three components of IL23 signalling and Th17 cell differentiation: JAK2 rs10758669, STAT3 rs744166 and CCR6 rs2301436 initially associated with CD in Hungarian CD and UC patients. A total of 616 unrelated subjects with either form of IBD and 496 healthy controls were genotyped with PCR-RFLP methods. We also tested the genetic interactions of JAK2, STAT3 and CCR6 polymorphisms in a pairwise fashion with regard to disease risk. We could confirm the susceptibility of STAT3 rs744166 TT homozygotes for UC (OR: 1.483, 95% CI: 1.103-1.992, P = 0.009). Data on genetic interaction reveals that the above JAK2 and STAT3 risk alleles contribute to CD susceptibility in combination with each other (OR: 2.218; 95% CI: 1.097-4.487; P = 0.024), while the JAK2 variant shows a tendency to confer UC risk only on a wild-type STAT3 background (OR: 1.997, 95%CI: 0.994-4.009, P = 0.049). Our results may help in understanding how these natural variants contribute to development of IBD through their genetic association.
