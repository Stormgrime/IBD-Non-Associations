INTRODUCTION: Vedolizumab is an anti-integrin approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. By binding the alpha4beta7-integrin heterodimer, vedolizumab blocks leukocyte translocation into gastrointestinal tissue. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the chemistry, pharmacologic properties, clinical efficacy, and safety of vedolizumab in ulcerative colitis. Other medications available for the treatment of ulcerative colitis are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Vedolizumab is a promising new agent for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Its mechanism of action differs from TNF-alpha inhibitors and immune suppressants, allowing it to be used in cases of TNF-alpha inhibitor failure or non-response, or as a first-line biologic drug. Available safety data suggests that vedolizumab is not associated with an increased risk of infection or malignancy; however, additional post-marketing data are required to confirm these initial reports. Vedolizumab is likely to be used in growing numbers of patients over the coming years.
