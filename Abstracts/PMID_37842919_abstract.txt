Anti-TNF therapy can induce and maintain a remission status during intestinal bowel disease. However, up to 30% of patients do not respond to this therapy by mechanisms that are unknown. Here, we show that the absence of MCJ, a natural inhibitor of the respiratory chain Complex I, induces gut microbiota changes that are critical determinants of the lack of response in a murine model of DSS-induced inflammation. First, we found that MCJ expression is restricted to macrophages in human colonic tissue. Therefore, we demonstrate by transcriptomic analysis of colon macrophages from DSS-induced mice that MCJ-deficiency is linked to the expression of genes belonging to the FcgammaR signaling pathway and contains an anti-TNF refractory gene signature identified in ulcerative colitis patients. The gut microbial composition changes observed upon DSS treatment in the MCJ-deficient mice revealed the increased presence of specific colitogenic members, including Ruminococcus gnavus and Oscillospira, which could be associated with the non-response to TNF inhibitors. Further, we show that the presence of a microbiota associated resistance to treatment is dominant and transmissible to responsive individuals. Collectively, our findings underscore the critical role played by macrophage mitochondrial function in the gut ecological niche that can substantially affect not only the severity of inflammation but also the ability to successfully respond to current therapies.
