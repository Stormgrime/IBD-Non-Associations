BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma is a transcription factor, highly expressed in colonic epithelial cells, adipose tissue and macrophages, with an important role in the regulation of inflammatory pathways. The common PPARgamma variants C161T and Pro12Ala have recently been associated with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and an extensive UC phenotype respectively, in a Chinese population. PPARgamma Pro12Ala variant homozygotes appear to be protected from the development of Crohn's disease (CD) in European Caucasians. METHODS: A case-control study was performed for both variants (CD n=575, UC n=306, Controls n=360) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in an Australian IBD cohort. A transmission disequilibrium test was also performed using CD trios for the PPARgamma C161T variant. Genotype-phenotype analyses were also undertaken. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in genotype distribution data or allele frequency between CD and UC patients and controls. There was no difference in allele transmission for the C161T variant. No significant relationship between the variants and disease location was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to replicate in a Caucasian cohort the recent association between PPARgamma C161T and UC or between PPARgamma Pro12Ala and an extensive UC phenotype in a Chinese population. There are significant ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility to IBD and its phenotypic expression.
