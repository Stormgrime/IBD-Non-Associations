Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory bowel disease. UC confronts with severe challenges including the unclear pathogenesis and lack of specific diagnostic markers, demanding for identifying predictive biomarkers for UC diagnosis and treatment. We perform immune infiltration and weighted gene co-expression network analysis on gene expression profiles of active UC, inactive UC, and normal controls to identify UC related immune cell and hub genes. Neutrophils, M1 macrophages, activated dendritic cells, and activated mast cells are significantly enriched in active UC. MMP-9, CHI3L1, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCR2 and S100A9 are identified as hub genes in active UC. Specifically, S100A9 is significantly overexpressed in mice with colitis. The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrates the excellent performance of S100A9 expression in diagnosing active UC. Inhibition of S100A9 expression reduces DSS-induced colonic inflammation. These identified biomarkers associated with activity in UC patients enlighten the new insights of UC diagnosis and treatment.
