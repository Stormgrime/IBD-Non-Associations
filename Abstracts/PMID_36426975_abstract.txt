Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and a major cause of mortality. Proinflammatory and antitumor immune responses play critical roles in colitis-associated colon cancer. CCL17, a chemokine of the C-C family and ligand for CCR4, is expressed by intestinal dendritic cells in the steady state and is upregulated during colitis in mouse models and inflammatory bowel disease patients. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and functional relevance of CCL17 for colitis-associated colon tumor development using CCL17-enhanced GFP-knockin mice. CCL17 was highly expressed by dendritic cells but also upregulated in macrophages and intermediary monocytes in colon tumors induced by exposure to azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate. Despite a similar degree of inflammation in the colon, CCL17-deficient mice developed fewer tumors than did CCL17-competent mice. This protective effect was abrogated by cohousing, indicating a dependency on the microbiota. Changes in microbiota diversity and composition were detected in separately housed CCL17-deficient mice, and these mice were more susceptible to azoxymethane-induced early apoptosis in the colon affecting tumor initiation. Immune cell infiltration in colitis-induced colon tumors was not affected by the lack of CCL17. Taken together, our results indicate that CCL17 promotes colitis-associated tumorigenesis by influencing the composition of the intestinal microbiome and reducing apoptosis during tumor initiation.
