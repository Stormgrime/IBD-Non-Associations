Colorectal cancer (CRC) occurs with an increased incidence in individuals with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the colon. Recent data suggest that a family history of colorectal cancer is an independent risk factor for CRC in IBD, an observation that implies that genetic factors are relevant to the development of CRC in this context. Among the genetic defects associated with CRC, the APC I1307K mutation has been detected nearly exclusively in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) origin, occurring in 6%-7% of the AJ general population and in 10%-28% of AJ with a either a personal or family history of CRC or adenomatous polyps. These findings, together with the increased incidence of IBD in AJ, prompted the current analysis of the contribution of the APC I1307K variant of CRC in AJ IBD patients. APC I1307K carrier frequencies were determined in 306 AJ individuals affected with IBD and 308 of their unaffected relatives ascertained from a family collection obtained for the identification of IBD susceptibility genes. Prevalence of the I1307K variant was not significantly different among individuals with IBD, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and unaffected relatives (6.9%, 7.6%, 4.7%, and 6.2%, respectively), and the mutation was detected in only one of five IBD-affected individuals with a diagnosis of CRC. These results reveal that IBD patients of AJ origin carry the APC I1307K variant at the same rate as individuals within the general AJ population. Lack of an increased APC I1307K carrier rate suggests that this mutation does not account for the increased CRC susceptibility associated with IBD.
