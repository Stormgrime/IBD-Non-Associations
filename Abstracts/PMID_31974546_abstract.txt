BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is paucity of data on safety and efficacy of anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] in elderly inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients. We aimed to compare the long-term treatment failure rates and safety of a first anti-TNF agent in IBD patients between different age groups [<40 years/40-59 years/>/=60 years]. METHODS: IBD patients who started a first anti-TNF agent were identified through IBDREAM, a multicentre prospective IBD registry. Competing risk regression was used to study treatment failure, defined as time to drug discontinuation due to adverse events [AEs] or lack of effectiveness, with discontinuation due to remission as a competing risk. RESULTS: A total of 895 IBD patients were included; 546 started anti-TNF at age <40 [61.0%], 268 at age 40-59 [29.9%], and 81 at age >/=60 [9.1%]. Treatment failure rate was higher in the two older groups (subhazard rate [SHR] age >/=60 1.46, SHR age 40-59 1.21; p = 0.03). The SHR in the elderly [>60] was 1.52 for discontinuation due to AEs and 1.11 for lack of effectiveness. Concomitant thiopurine use was associated with a lower treatment failure rate (SHR 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.98, p = 0.031). Serious adverse event [SAE] rate, as well as serious infection rate, were significantly higher in elderly IBD patients [61.2 versus 16.0 and 12.4 per 1000 patient-years, respectively] whereas the malignancy rate was low in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly IBD patients starting a first anti-TNF agent showed higher treatment failure rates, but concomitant thiopurine use at baseline was associated with lower failure rates. Elderly IBD patients demonstrated higher rates of SAEs and serious infections.
