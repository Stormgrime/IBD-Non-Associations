BACKGROUND AND AIM: Strategies to reduce relapse using immunomodulators (IMs) after discontinuing anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibody treatment are controversial in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study, we assessed the association between IMs after discontinuing anti-TNF-alpha antibody treatment and relapse in patients with UC. METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 257 patients with UC in clinical remission. These patients discontinued anti-TNF-alpha antibody treatment between June 2010 and March 2019 and were followed up until March 2020. We evaluated the differences in relapse rates between patients with IMs (IM group) and those without IMs (non-IM group) after discontinuing the treatment. Relapse was defined as further undergoing an induction treatment or colectomy. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for confounders were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for relapse. Exploratory analyses were performed to identify other factors that could predict relapse. RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 22 months (interquartile range: 10-41), 114 relapses occurred: 42/100 (42.0%) in the IM group and 72/157 (45.9%) in the non-IM group. In the multivariable analysis, IMs were not associated with relapse (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.64-1.41]). In the exploratory analyses, discontinuation due to side effects (HR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.18-2.82]) and younger age (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.98-1.00]) predicted relapse. CONCLUSION: Immunomodulators were not associated with relapse after discontinuing anti-TNF-alpha antibody treatment in patients with UC. Careful patient follow-up is needed when discontinuing due to side effects or when the patient is of a younger age at the time of discontinuation.
