BACKGROUND: Intestinal fibrosis is a serious complication of Crohn's disease. Numerous cell types including intestinal epithelial and mesenchymal cells are implicated in this process, yet studies are hampered by the lack of personalized in vitro models. Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) contain these cell types, and our goal was to determine the feasibility of utilizing these to develop a personalized intestinal fibrosis model. METHODS: iPSCs from 2 control individuals and 2 very early onset inflammatory bowel disease patients with stricturing complications were obtained and directed to form HIOs. Purified populations of epithelial and mesenchymal cells were derived from HIOs, and both types were treated with the profibrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA sequencing analysis were used to assay their responses. RESULTS: In iPSC-derived mesenchymal cells, there was a significant increase in the expression of profibrotic genes (Col1a1, Col5a1, and TIMP1) in response to TGFbeta. RNA sequencing analysis identified further profibrotic genes and demonstrated differential responses to this cytokine in each of the 4 lines. Increases in profibrotic gene expression (Col1a1, FN, TIMP1) along with genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (vimentin and N-cadherin) were observed in TGFbeta -treated epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing iPSC-HIO technology to model intestinal fibrotic responses in vitro. This now permits the generation of near unlimited quantities of patient-specific cells that could be used to reveal cell- and environmental-specific mechanisms underpinning intestinal fibrosis.
