BACKGROUND: The phase 3 (UNIFI) trial of ustekinumab (anti-interleukin 12/23) demonstrated efficacy even after prior biologic failure in adult ulcerative colitis (UC), but paediatric data are lacking. AIM: To prospectively monitor efficacy and serum concentrations of ustekinumab given to children with UC refractory to other biologics. METHODS: Children with anti-TNF refractory UC initiating ustekinumab intravenously at sites of the Canadian Children IBD Network prior to 12/2019 are included. The primary endpoint was steroid-free clinical remission with subcutaneous ustekinumab at 52 weeks (Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index <10, no steroids >/=4 weeks). Ustekinumab levels were measured after week 20. Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore </=1, or faecal calprotectin (FCP) <250 mug/g if not re-colonoscoped. RESULTS: At six sites between 01/2018 and 11/2019, 25 children (median [IQR] age 14.8 years [12.3-16.2], 72% female) with UC duration 2.3 years (1.1-4.2) received intravenous ustekinumab (median dose/kg of 6.4 [5.5-7.5] mg). All patients had failed prior infliximab therapy, and 12 (48%) also vedolizumab. Five patients discontinued ustekinumab after IV induction (four undergoing colectomy). On intent to treat basis, 44% achieved the primary endpoint of steroid-free remission at week 52, including nine (69%) of 13 who previously treated with anti-TNF only vs two (17%) of 12 who previously failed also by vedolizumab (P = 0.008). Seven of 11 remitters met the criteria for endoscopic improvement. The median (IQR) trough levels (mug/mL) were greater with q4 vs q8 weekly dosing (8.7 [4.6-9.9] vs 3.8 [12.7-4.8]) P = 0.02, but greater exposure was not associated with a superior rate of clinical remission. No adverse events were associated with therapy. CONCLUSION: Ustekinumab demonstrated efficacy in this paediatric cohort with otherwise treatment-refractory UC. Treatment failure was not due to inadequate drug exposure.
