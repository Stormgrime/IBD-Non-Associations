BACKGROUND: The effect of preoperative vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy on postoperative complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is still controversial. This meta-analysis aims to review postoperative complications of IBD patients who preoperatively received VDZ. METHODS: A meta-analysis of the available literature was performed. Studies of IBD patients who received VDZ and non-VDZ therapy (including anti-TNF-alpha agents, non-biological therapy, other biological agents, ustekinumab, and placebo) before surgery were included. Primary outcomes included overall complications, infectious complications, and non-infectious complications. RESULTS: Twelve studies with 1925 IBD patients were enrolled, among which 709 patients received VDZ treatment. The results show that, compared with non-VDZ treatment, there is no significant difference in the incidence of overall complications (OR = 1.25, p = 0.43) for adult IBD patients treated with VDZ preoperatively, the incidence of infectious complications (OR = 0.49, p = 0.001) decreases, but the risks of all surgical site infection (SSI) (Crohn's disease (CD): OR = 2.97, p < 0.001), superficial surgical site infection (sSSI) (OR = 2.24, p = 0.02), and ileus (OR = 2.16, p < 0.001) increase. The risk of mucocutaneous separation (MCS) (OR = 4.69, p = 0.03) with VDZ is also higher than non-VDZ. Two studies involved pediatric patients and showed no difference in ileus (OR = 0.55, p = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, compared with non-VDZ treatment, preoperative use of VDZ is relatively safer in adult IBD patients, which does not increase the risk of overall postoperative complications and reduces the occurrence of infectious complications. But, it increases the risk of all SSI and sSSI in infectious complications and the incidence of ileus and MCS in non-infectious complications. Due to lack of sufficient data, the safety of VDZ in pediatric patients is uncertain and requires further study.
