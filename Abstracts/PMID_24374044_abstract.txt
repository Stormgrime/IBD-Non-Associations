OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether CTLA-4 gene variants were associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Meta-analysis was conducted on the association between CTLA-4 variants and IBD using: (1) allelic contrast, (2) the recessive model, and (3) the dominant model. RESULTS: A total of 9 relevant studies including 1739 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 10 relevant studies containing 1017 ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 2685 healthy controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, CTLA-4+49A/G, -318C/T and CT60 variants were not associated with IBD susceptibility in all genetic models (P>0.05). Stratification by ethnicity indicated a significant association between the CTLA-4+49A/G variant and CD in Caucasian group (GG vs. GA+AA: OR=0.723, 95% CI=0.564-0.926, P=0.010). In Asian group, meta-analysis showed a significant association between the CTLA-4 CT60 variant and UC (AA vs. AG+GG: OR=0.375, 95% CI=0.163-0.861, P=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the published literature, this meta-analysis suggests that the CTLA-4+49A/G variant may be related to CD susceptibility in Caucasians, and the CTLA-4 CT60 variant may be associated with UC susceptibility in Asians.
