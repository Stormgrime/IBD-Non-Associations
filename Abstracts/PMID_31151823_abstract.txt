Transition metals are required for intestinal homeostasis and provide essential nutrients for the resident microbiota. Abnormalities in metal homeostasis are common in Crohn's disease (CD), but remain poorly defined and causes appear multifactorial. There has been renewed interest in understanding these mechanisms with the discovery of an association between a coding variant in SLC39A8 (rs13107325; ZIP8 A391T) and increased CD risk. SLC39A8 encodes the protein ZIP8, a metal transporter that is induced under inflammatory stimuli; however, studies of its gut-specific functions are lacking. Here, we show that SLC39A8 mRNA is differentially expressed in active CD with a high positive correlation with markers of disease severity, including CXCL8, TNFalpha, IFNgamma, and calprotectin. SLC39A8 expression exhibits a negative correlation with SLC39A4 and SLC39A5, two key zinc importers in absorptive enterocytes, and a lack of correlation with two manganese transporters, SLC39A14 and SLC11A2. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates ZIP8 expression in intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells of the lamina propria. Patients with CD exhibit variable patterns of ZIP8 subcellular localization within IECs. In ileal enteroids, SLC39A8 was induced by IFNgamma and IFNgamma + TNFalpha, but not by TNFalpha alone, independent of NF-kappaB activation. IFNgamma also down-regulated SLC39A5. To explore the functional implications of disease-associated genetic variation, in over-expression experiments in HEK293A cells, ZIP8 A391T was associated with increased TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, consistent with a loss of negative regulation. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for ZIP8 in intestinal inflammation, induced by IFNgamma in the intestinal epithelial compartment, and that perturbations in negative regulation of NF-kappaB by ZIP8 A391T may contribute to CD pathogenesis.
