Disruption of the lipid profile is commonly found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key molecule involved in triglyceride metabolism that plays a significant role in the progression of atherosclerosis. In this study, our aim was to study whether serum LPL levels are different in IBD patients and controls and whether IBD features are related to LPL. This was a cross-sectional study that encompassed 405 individuals; 197 IBD patients with a median disease duration of 12 years and 208 age- and sex-matched controls. LPL levels and a complete lipid profile were assessed in all individuals. A multivariable analysis was performed to determine whether LPL serum levels were altered in IBD and to study their relationship with IBD characteristics. After the fully multivariable analysis, including cardiovascular risk factors and the changes in lipid profile that the disease causes itself, patients with IBD showed significantly higher levels of circulating LPL (beta coefficient 196 (95% confidence interval from 113 to 259) ng/mL, p < 0.001). LPL serum levels did not differ between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. However, serum C-reactive protein levels, disease duration, and the presence of an ileocolonic Crohn's disease phenotype were found to be significantly and independently positively related to LPL. In contrast, LPL was not associated with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis. In conclusion, serum LPL levels were independently upregulated in patients with IBD. Inflammatory markers, disease duration and disease phenotype were responsible for this upregulation.
